# OpenDER Integration with OpenDSS

This repository contains the necessary code to perform simulations that assess voltage stability in electric power distribution networks interconnected with inverter-based generators (DERs). Using the IEEE Std 1547-2018 standards, the program integrates OpenDSS and OpenDER, enabling simulations of control modes such as Volt-VAr, Watt-VAr, and Volt-Watt in dynamic states.
